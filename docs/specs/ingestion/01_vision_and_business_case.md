# Ingestion Vision and Business Case (v1)

## 1) Why Ingestion Is a Core Business Capability

Rekindle's value proposition depends on always having fresh, relevant, actionable ideas. Without sustained ingestion capability:

- Search quality decays over time
- User novelty drops
- Catalog diversity stalls
- Editorial teams spend too much time manually sourcing

Ingestion should be treated as a product platform with ongoing ownership, SLAs, and roadmap investment.

## 2) Product Outcome We Want

Users consistently find ideas that feel:

- actionable now
- emotionally appropriate
- relevant to context and relationship
- varied and new over time

The catalog should feel alive, not static.

## 3) Business Outcomes We Want

1. Higher activation and retention from better idea discovery.
2. Lower cost per publishable idea through tooling leverage.
3. Faster catalog expansion into new domains and locales.
4. Increased editorial confidence through provenance and auditability.

## 4) Principles

1. Human control over publish decisions.
2. Machine assistance for discovery, extraction, prioritization, and dedupe.
3. Durable raw store separated from editorial product store.
4. Attribution and evidence retained end-to-end.
5. Safety and compliance as first-class gates, not afterthoughts.
6. Instrument everything and improve continuously.

## 5) Core Operational Model

Two loops run in parallel:

1. Machine Loop:
   - discover sources and pages
   - extract candidate content
   - score quality and risk
   - dedupe and prioritize
   - deliver to Studio inbox

2. Human Loop:
   - review and edit
   - reject or promote
   - capture reasons/labels
   - feed those labels back into the machine loop

This is a flywheel, not a pipeline that runs once.

## 6) Non-Goals

1. Automatic publishing from scraped content.
2. Treating all sources as equally trustworthy.
3. Optimizing for raw candidate count over accepted idea quality.

## 7) Definition of Success

Ingestion is successful when:

1. Editors can approve useful ideas quickly from a high-signal inbox.
2. Accepted-idea yield improves month-over-month.
3. Source portfolio grows with manageable maintenance cost.
4. System failures are observable, recoverable, and low-impact.
