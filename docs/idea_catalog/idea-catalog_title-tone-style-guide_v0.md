# Rekindle — Idea Title + Tone Style Guide (v0)

**Status:** High-level editorial guidance for consistent, emotionally safe Ideas

This guide defines how Rekindle catalog **Ideas** should be written so they are:

- **Fast to scan** (in lists and search results)
- **Easy to do** (actionable with minimal friction)
- **Emotionally safe** (no guilt, no pressure, no manipulation)
- **Generalizable** (usable across many relationships and situations)

It applies to human-written Ideas and AI-assisted drafts.

## 1) Core voice principles

### 1.1 Warm, encouraging, never demanding
Use language that feels like a supportive friend:

- Prefer: *"If it feels right…"* / *"You could try…"* / *"A simple option is…"*
- Avoid: *"You should…"* / *"You must…"* / *"Do this to fix…"*

### 1.2 No guilt / shame framing
Avoid implying the user is failing, selfish, or obligated.

- Avoid: *"They deserve better."* / *"Stop neglecting them."* / *"Make it up to them."*
- Prefer: *"A small check-in can help them feel remembered."*

### 1.3 Consent and boundaries are respected
When an idea involves touch, surprise, showing up unannounced, money, or emotional topics:

- Add a small boundary note in the description or steps.
- Prefer “coordinate first” framing when appropriate.

### 1.4 Inclusive and non-stereotyping
Default to **gender-neutral** and broadly applicable wording.

- Don’t assume hobbies, roles, or preferences based on gender, culture, age, or relationship type.
- Only use “gender fit” or tightly targeted relationship fit when it’s truly necessary, and document why.

### 1.5 Keep it realistic
Ideas should be doable by normal people with real constraints (time, energy, money).

- If an idea requires resources (car, budget, childcare, accessibility), state that clearly.

## 2) Title rules

### 2.1 Titles are verb-first and specific
**Do:**
- Start with a verb.
- Name a concrete action.
- Keep it short (usually 3–8 words).

**Avoid:**
- Abstract nouns (“Support”, “Kindness”, “Communication”).
- Vague verbs without object (“Help them”, “Be there”).

### 2.2 Titles should be “list-friendly”
Users will skim dozens of titles. The title should communicate the action *without needing the description*.

A good title answers: **what will I do?**

### 2.3 Use helpful constraints when they increase clarity
Adding a constraint can make a title feel more doable:

- time: “Send a 30-second voice note”
- scope: “Do one small chore for them”
- medium: “Text them a specific compliment”

---

## 3) Reason snippet rules

A reason snippet is one sentence explaining **why** this idea helps.

**Do:**
- Keep it empathetic and positive.
- Focus on the recipient’s felt experience (seen, supported, celebrated).

**Avoid:**
- Moralizing (“Good partners do this.”)
- Diagnosing (“They have abandonment issues.”)

**Template options:**
- “A small \[action\] can help them feel \[emotion\] without needing a big plan.”
- “\[Action\] is a simple way to show you’re thinking of them.”
- “When someone’s stressed, \[action\] can reduce friction and make the day feel lighter.”

---

## 4) Description + steps rules

### 4.1 Description: short, actionable, not a blog post
Aim for **2–6 lines**:

- what to do
- a concrete example phrase
- a boundary / coordination note if needed

### 4.2 Steps: optional, but great for clarity
If included, keep to **3–6 steps**, each starting with a verb.

Good step verbs: Pick, Choose, Write, Send, Ask, Bring, Set a time, Follow up.

### 4.3 Add “tips/variations” when they reduce friction
Examples:
- “If you’re not sure what to say, try: ‘I saw this and thought of you.’”
- “If they’re busy, keep it to one question and no follow-ups.”

### 4.4 Safety/boundaries notes are short and non-alarmist
Examples:
- “If they’re in a tough season, keep it light and avoid pushing for details.”
- “If surprises aren’t their thing, ask first.”

---

## 5) Practical-help micro-chores policy (editorial)

We intentionally avoid flooding the **catalog** with granular chores like:
- “Take out the trash”
- “Do the dishes”
- “Fold laundry”

These are valid as **personal wishes** (because they are real needs), but they are usually too literal/noisy for the catalog.

**Preferred approach:** abstract into a small set of reusable “acts of service” templates, such as:
- “Take one chore off their plate today”
- “Handle a task they’ve been avoiding”
- “Do a quick ‘reset’ of a shared space”

---

## 6) Examples

### 6.1 Titles — good vs bad

**Good titles**
- Send a quick voice note
- Text them a specific compliment
- Ask one thoughtful question
- Share a photo and a memory
- Drop off their favorite snack
- Plan a simple picnic
- Take one chore off their plate
- Make them a short playlist
- Schedule a 10-minute catch-up
- Write a “thinking of you” card

**Bad titles (too vague / not scannable)**
- Be supportive
- Communication
- Quality time
- Do something nice
- Help them feel better
- Make them happy
- Be a better friend
- Surprise them
- Fix the relationship
- Cheer them up

### 6.2 Reason snippets — good vs bad

**Good**
- “A short voice note feels personal and helps someone feel remembered.”
- “A specific compliment lands better than a generic ‘you’re great.’”

**Bad**
- “If you cared, you’d check in more.”
- “This will fix their insecurity.”

### 6.3 Description rewrites (user text → catalog)

**Raw user wish (too specific):**
> “Take Mom to her favorite sushi place on 7th Ave this Friday.”

**Catalog rewrite (generalizable):**
- **Title:** Take them to their favorite restaurant
- **Reason:** “Choosing a place they love makes them feel known and considered.”
- **Description:** “Pick a spot you know they enjoy, set a time, and keep it simple. If schedules are tight, even a quick lunch counts.”

## 7) AI drafting rules (quick checklist)

When using ChatGPT to generate or rewrite ideas:

- Titles must be verb-first.
- No guilt/shame language.
- No manipulation (“make them”, “prove”, “win them back”).
- Keep suggestions inclusive and realistic.
- If a facet is ambiguous, **leave it blank or offer alternatives** rather than guessing.
- Convert micro-chores into higher-level service templates (do not add 100 chore rows).

## 8) “Definition of good” (what reviewers should look for)

An Idea is well-written if a user can:

1) understand the action from the title alone,
2) feel encouraged (not pressured),
3) do it without extra planning beyond what’s described,
4) see how it fits a person/moment via tags,
5) trust it won’t create awkwardness or boundary issues.
